# Play Store Data Analysis

 # Overview

This project explores and analyzes the Google Play Store dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about apps —
including their ratings, categories, types (free/paid), install counts, and reviews. The goal was to extract meaningful business insights using data analysis and visualization.

# Tools & Technologies

 * Language: Python 

 * Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

 * Environment: Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset Description

-- The dataset includes the following key features:

* App Name

* Category

* Rating

* Reviews

* Installs

* Type (Free or Paid)

* Price

* Content Rating

* Genres

* Last Updated, and more.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Highlights

 * Cleaned and preprocessed data (removed duplicates, handled null values, converted columns)

 * Analyzed distribution of app categories and user ratings
 
 * Compared Free vs Paid apps in terms of pricing and popularity

 * Identified top-rated categories and most downloaded apps

 * Visualized correlations between features like reviews, installs, and ratings


# Key Insights

 * Free apps dominate the Play Store, but Paid apps often have slightly higher average ratings

 * Categories like Games, Productivity, and Education have the highest app counts

 * Apps with more installs tend to have better ratings, but not always — quality still matters

 * A significant number of apps have inflated review counts, showing importance of outlier handling

# Project Goals

 * Practice real-world data wrangling

 * Extract insights from unstructured business data

 * Visualize patterns that help app developers & marketers make data-backed decisions
